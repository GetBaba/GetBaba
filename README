<hl align="center"> Hello, I'm Baptiste! 👋


## About Me

I'm a student currently based in Madrid, completing my Msc in Business Analytics & Big Data at IE University. Passionate about data science and analytics, I am particularly interested in the FinTech and FoodTech industries, and curious to see how we can leverage AI to solve some of the most pressing matters of day. 
On the side, my main hobbies include playing chess; skateboarding and playing basketball.
