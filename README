## About Me

I'm a junior data scientist currently based in Madrid. Passionate about data science and analytics, I am particularly interested in the tech industry, and curious to see how we can leverage AI to solve some of the most pressing matters of day. 
On the side, my main hobbies include playing chess; skateboarding; kitesurfing; and playing basketball.
